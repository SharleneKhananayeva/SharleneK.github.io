    <h2 class="heading">Women and girls all across the world are exposed to violence and discrimination on a daily basis. Regardless of age, background, or country, one out of every three women may experience physical or sexual assault in her lifetime, and every country in the world has laws that treat women and girls as second-class citizens. </h2>

    <!--<p id="home"> Women's general well-being is significantly impacted by violence, which stops them from fully participating in society. It has an impact on their families, communities, and the country as a whole. It comes at a high price, from increased health-care costs to legal fees and lost productivity. At least 155 countries have implemented domestic violence legislation, while 140 have passed workplace sexual harassment legislation (World Bank 2020). However, executing these rules remains a difficulty, limiting women's and girls' access to protection and justice. Violence is not effectively prevented, and when it does occur, it is frequently unpunished.</p>

<h3 class="heading"> Gender equality  "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike." - UNICEF </h3>
